# dNN
Nearest neighbors algorithm with fixed neighborhood radius instead of number of neighbors

Note that the variable space is normalized to the standard deviation of each variable, and the user defines the "normalized volume" which converts to normalized radius, defined by
normalized_volume = normalized_radius ^ {number_of_variables}.
