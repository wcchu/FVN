# dNN
Distance-based Nearest neighbors algorithm

* Distance is calculated in normalized variable space
* User specifies the volume of the hyper-dimensional "neighborhood ball", thus fixing the radius of the ball: (normalized volume) = (normalized radius) ^ (number of variables)
* Variable space is normalized to the standard deviation of the distribution of each variable
